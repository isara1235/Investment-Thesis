# Investment-Thesis
Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal repo where I collect interesting Web3 projects that I am excited about. Think of it as a public notebook where I share what I am exploring, why I think something is worth paying attention to, and how I believe it could play out over time.

# What is this?
I spend a lot of time researching crypto and Web3. Whenever I come across a project that feels special or has strong potential, I write down my thoughts here. These could be infrastructure plays, DeFi protocols, consumer apps, or anything that makes me think.

-Each project usually comes with a short write-up that includes:

-What the project is

-Why I like it

-What could go wrong

-Any major updates or milestones I am tracking

# Why am I doing this?
There is a lot of noise in crypto. This is my way of filtering through it and staying focused on what actually matters. It also helps me look back and reflect on how my thinking changes over time.

If you are also exploring the space, I hope you find some of these notes useful or thought-provoking.

# How to use this repo
Browse the folders by theme or just explore the files that interest you. Everything is written in a casual tone and meant to be easy to read. I will keep updating things as I learn more or change my mind.

A quick note
This is not investment advice. It is just one person thinking out loud on the internet.
